"""
Now that you know how to read a file, letâ€™s write a program to perform a simple calculation.

The columns in portfolio.csv correspond to the stock name, number of shares, and purchase price of a single stock holding. 
Write a program called pcost.py that opens this file, reads all lines, and calculates how much it cost to purchase all of the shares in the portfolio.

Hint: to convert a string to an integer, use int(s). To convert a string to a floating point, use float(s).

Your program should print output such as the following:

Total cost 44671.15

        add_list.append(product)
        result = sum(add_list)
